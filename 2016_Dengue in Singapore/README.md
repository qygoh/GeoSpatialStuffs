# Undergrad GIS Group Project

For course GE3216: Applications of GIS & Remote Sensing. Completed Year: 2016

## Topic: Dengue in Singapore

We were tasked to work on any topic that is of interest to us, but some form of raster processing should be featured as part of the project. Eventually, we came out with a game plan that did exactly that, using Dengue in Singapore as an example. 

In Sunny Singapore, the National Environmental Agency's banners for dengue vilgilance and prevention is a common sight:

In turn, we wanted to explore what the factors actually affects the number of dengue cases in Singapore. Existing literature then found high temperature, rainy seasons, population density, etc to have a positive relationship to the number of dengue cases for the countries they were studying. Guided by that and data avaliability, we chose to study if the following factors had any relationships to the number of dengue cases in Singapore: 

- Proximity to Vegetation
- Proximity to Large Waterbodies
- Temperature
- Rainfall
- Distance to Construction Sites
