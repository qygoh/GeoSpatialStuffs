# Undergrad GIS Group Project

For course GE3216: Applications of GIS & Remote Sensing. Completed Year: 2016

## Topic: Dengue in Singapore

We were tasked to work on any topic that is of interest to us, but some form of raster processing should be featured as part of the project. Eventually, we came out with a game plan that did exactly that, using Dengue in Singapore as an example. 

In Sunny Singapore, we are all very familiar with the National Environmental Agency's banners asking us to stay vigilant and prevent accumulation of still water in our living environment:

We therefore wanted to find out which factors contributes significantly to the number of dengue cases in Singapore.
