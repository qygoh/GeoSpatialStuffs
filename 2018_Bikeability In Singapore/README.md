# Undergrad GIS Group Project

For course RE2301: GIS for Real Estate. 
Completed: Year 2018

## Topic: Bikeability in Singapore 
Fun fact: Back then we were seniors taking a lower level module, so we thought why don't we proceed to choose a fun topic that allows us to overkill and demonstrate all the GIS skills we had? :') 

Bikeability was therefore the interesting topic chosen for the aspiring urban planners that we were.

We wanted to evaluate bikeability throughout Singapore following the work of Van Dyck et al. (2012) and Winters et al. (2012), which created a Bikeability Index that essentially quantifies the factors affecting bikeability. Having a Bikeability Index allows comparisions of scores across regions too. 

Quantificable factors are needed to build the Index, and the following was chosen based on existing literatures and avaliability of data:

## QY's role in the group project
I mainly handled the raster data processing and maps calculations/visualizations for the project. 

This was done at a time when I did not know how to code, so the most advanced skill I had was to figure out how to do raster processing on ESRI ArcGIS (because in school we were mostly taught how to deal with vector data). 

## Key technical skills
- Raster data processing: Slope calculations from Digital Elevation Terrain Raster data, Zonal Statistics
- Vector data processing: Interpolation (of rainfall and temperature from weather stations in Singapore)

## And Finally...
All good projects are done with the help of awesome-r teammates, so here is a shoutout to my fellow project mates back then @ Amanda Lim, Charis Tan, Ho Yihan and Hu Huidi!
