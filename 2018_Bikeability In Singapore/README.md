# Undergrad GIS Group Project

For course RE2301: GIS for Real Estate. 
Completed: Year 2018

## Topic: Bikeability in Singapore 
Fun fact: Back then we were seniors taking a lower level module, so we thought why don't we proceed to choose a fun topic that allows us to overkill and demonstrate all the GIS skills we had? :') 

Bikeability was therefore the interesting topic chosen for the aspiring urban planners that we were. 


## Technical notes 
This was done at a time where I did not know how to code yet, so the most advanced skill I had was to figure out how to do raster processing on ESRI ArcGIS. 

## And Finally...
All good projects are done with the help of awesome-r teammates, so here is a shoutout to my fellow project mates back then @ Amanda Lim, Charis Tan, Ho Yihan and Hu Huidi.
